# Rock Pool Organism Classifier

This app was built during a 48 hour hackathon as a tool for identifying and classifying the organisms found in rock pools, as well as geotagging their location.

Please note that some of the newer commits are missing in this repository, which may result in the app being less refined as in the images below.

## Technologies Used

*   React Native
*   TypeScript
*   Firestore

## Features

*   Take a photo of the rock pool you found, it will then be uploaded and the organisms in the rock pools will be classified.
*   View all rock pools around you and view what's in them.
*   Create new rock pools and geo tag them.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you will need to have React Native installed on your machine. Follow the instructions [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to set up your development environment.

Once you have React Native set up, clone this repository, set up firestore and install the dependencies:

* `git clone https://github.com/Ayman-cds/RockPoolClassifier`
* `npm install`

To run the app, use the following command:

* `npm start`

This will start the React Native development server and you should be able to view the app in a simulator or on your physical device.
